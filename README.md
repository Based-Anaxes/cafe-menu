# cafe-menu
Welcome to my cafe menu page! 

In this project I created a cafe-menu based on the fictional cafe, The Roost, as seen in the video game series Animal Crossing. 

THis page serves as a demonstration of my skills in Basic CSS. 

IF you want to see the reference I used for creating and styling this page, there is an image of my reference in the "img" folder named "reference".
